\title{Gets Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data from 'mapzen' via 'Amazon Public Datasets'}
\usage{
mapzen_dem(lat, long, square_km, width_buffer = 1, max_tiles = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{lat}{WGS84 latitude. Either a single point to use as the centre for a \code{square_km} sized raster, or a vector of track points}

\item{long}{WGS84 longitude. Either a single point to use as the centre for a \code{square_km} sized raster, or a vector of track points}

\item{square_km}{length of one edge the required square area, in km. Ignored if lat and long have length > 1}

\item{width_buffer}{If lat and long have length > 1, used as buffer distance around the provided points in km}

\item{max_tiles}{maximum number of map tiles to request. More tiles will give higher resolution scenes but take longer to download. Note that very small numbers of tiles may result in a scene that is not square.}
}
\value{
a raster with values corresponding to terrain height in metres
